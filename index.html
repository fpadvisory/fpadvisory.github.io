              <h3>About Us</h3>
              <p>
              First Principles Advisory Group is a boutique management consultancy focused exclusively on life sciences innovation, with service offerings covering product development strategy, project and program management, portfolio management, and market research. Our firm’s areas of expertise and staff experience uniquely bridge strategy and operations, helping our clients to meet growth challenges in these two key areas.<br><br>
              The firm was founded in 2009 and is headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area, though our footprint extends to the Boston/Cambridge and Washington DC/Maryland biotech hubs. With a carefully selected core staff that has yet to exceed 15 members, we’ve accrued a client list that includes the largest pharma and biotech bellwethers, notable earlier stage companies, and seed-stage startups.<br><br>
              We are not a consultancy in the traditional mold; we’ve assembled a group of mid-career professionals of varied backgrounds and personal interests, who share an interest in applying deep, critical thinking towards helping our clients with their most challenging business questions and needs. Our staff backgrounds include consultancy, industry, and academia. We’re not interested in mimicking the Big Three model and we believe that we do some of the best work out there in our areas of expertise.<br><br>
